## Welcome

Hello! My name is Emma Fling, and I am a current Master's student focusing on Water Conservation! As you will find exploring this website, which goes deep into my academic career, I am a nerd when it comes to water and am thrilled to be transitioning into the professional world. Having completed my undergraduate studies at CSU and almost finished my Master's, I have a deep understanding of all things water, from law to hydrology to social uses! Feel free to reach out to me through the links below, and let's talk water!
